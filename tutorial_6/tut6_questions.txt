1.When a process creates a copy of itself. Where a parent process creates a
  child process and waits till the child process has finished to join. This
  differs from multithreads because multithreads can run at the same time while
  forked parent processes are required to wait for the child processes to change
  before completing.

2.Inter-process comminication allows system processes to communicate and share
  data between each other. Using mutex locks, signals and barriers are some
  of the methods for IPC.

3.Semiphores are abstract data that controls access to a resource by all processes.
  Mutexes are when threads that are in a controlled section and accessing a
  resource that is to be used in other threads. When a thread is in a controlled
  section, all other threads must wait for the thread to finish its controlled
  section in order to access the resource.
