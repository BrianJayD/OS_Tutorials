5. The functions required to create a mutex lock are: init(), and lock()/unlock().

The init() function initializes a mutex to be used by the program and sets up a lock around any critical section of code. 

lock() sets up a lock to ensure that only the current thread using the lock can run its critical section.
If another peice of code would try to set the lock that's already set, it would have to wait.

unlock() releases the lock from the thread, so that another waiting thread can set it, and run its critical section.
